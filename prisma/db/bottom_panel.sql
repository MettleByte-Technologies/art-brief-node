Maintain the exact poster size of {bannerSize} pixels in portrait ratio â€” no exceptions.

Use {preferences} to guide the overall style, mood, and color scheme â€” apply colors wisely for strong visual appeal and professional aesthetics.

Ensure all text is properly aligned with uniform spacing. Maintain equal padding on all sides to achieve a clean, professional, and visually balanced layout.

Avoid cropping any text â€” apply consistent padding throughout the poster to preserve readability and design harmony.

Handle input_image[] as follows:

Logo: If applicable, integrate subtly to ensure brand consistency with the top poster.

Inspiration images: Use only for visual mood, not for direct inclusion.

Headshot: Include only if provided and if it contributes to an aesthetically balanced layout.

This bottom panel should visually align with the top poster but can include additional details, secondary messages, or support content.

Emphasize visual continuity from the top panel â€” keep styling consistent while allowing creative flexibility in layout.

Contact information from {contacts} (Only include contacts with position marked as `bottom` or `top and bottom`.
Do not include any contacts marked `top` only.
Place all contacts near the bottom of this poster for visual balance.).

Use clean, modern typography that is readable at a distance and suitable for print.

Avoid icons, UI-style elements, or clutter.

The result should be visually cohesive, professionally designed, and appropriate for public display in a business context.'
